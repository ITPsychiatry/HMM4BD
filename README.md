# HMM4BD
Smartphone-based monitoring of bipolar disorder with speech signal and hidden Markov Models

This repository contains a set of running examples inspired by real-life data related to the monitoring of BD patients with speech signal. Changes in speech and behavioral patterns in depression and mania are well-known clinically and were confirmed as promising markers for mental health monitoring. However, the majority of the related work on mental health monitoring limits the analyses to static learning approaches that ignore the temporal nature of the collected data. We propose a framework HMM4BD for monitoring mental state through speech signals and hidden Markov models (HMMs).
